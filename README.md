## Introduction
M5TimerCam-IPCamera transforms M5TimerCAM hardware into a robust IP camera focused on security applications. This project is ideal for remote monitoring and surveillance, offering high-quality imaging and WiFi connectivity for real-time observation.

## Features
- High-resolution security imaging with adjustable settings.
- WiFi connectivity for remote surveillance and monitoring.
- Accessible web portal for live feed viewing and camera configuration.
- Integration with Linux Motion project for advanced motion detection and video surveillance.

## Hardware Requirements
- M5TimerCAM module
- Suitable power supply
- Any additional peripherals (e.g., batteries, cases, etc.) required for secure installation

## Software Dependencies
- ESP32 Camera library
- WiFi library
- Other libraries as per the project's requirements

## Installation

### 1. Preparing the Environment
Ensure that you have the necessary development environment for ESP32, which typically includes:

- [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) or [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/)
- ESP32 board definitions for the Arduino IDE or PlatformIO
- Relevant libraries (as mentioned in Software Dependencies)

### 2. Setting up the Hardware
Assemble your M5TimerCAM module according to the manufacturer's instructions, ensuring stable power supply and connectivity suitable for security monitoring.

### 3. Flashing the Firmware
1. Open the provided code in Arduino IDE.
2. Replace the 'ssid' and 'password' variables with your WiFi credentials.
3. Select the appropriate board and port in your IDE.
4. Upload the code to your M5TimerCAM.

## Usage

### Accessing the Web Portal
Once the device is operational and connected to your network:

1. Navigate to the IP address displayed on the serial monitor using any web browser.
2. Utilize the web portal to view the live feed and adjust camera settings such as brightness, saturation, and frame size and more!.

### Integrating with Linux Motion
For a comprehensive security system, integrate M5TimerCam-IPCamera with the Linux Motion project:

- Set up the Linux Motion software on your server or a dedicated computer.
- Configure Motion to recognize and use the M5TimerCam-IPCamera's live feed.
- Utilize Motion's features for motion detection, alerts, and recordings.

## Customization
Customize the IP camera for various security needs:
- Adjust WiFi settings for different network environments.
- Fine-tune image quality and frame size for optimal surveillance.
- Integrate with home automation or security systems for enhanced functionality.

## Troubleshooting
- Ensure all connections are secure and board settings are correct if the camera does not start.
- Verify your SSID and password for WiFi connectivity issues.
- Refer to the serial monitor for diagnostic information.
